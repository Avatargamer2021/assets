    "description": "Avatar Gamer is based on liquidity generation and autonomous yield protocol that helps the token holders earn Static Rewards while also enhancing the liquidity of the pool. This is funded by 9% of the transaction fee taken from each transaction (buy/sell). This protocol has a permanently increasing-price floor, with all investors earning additional Avatar Gamer tokens for holding. In addition, our anti-carpet and anti-whale mechanisms also help to create a stable floor.",
